# Racket_programming
This repository is a collection of personal codes I wrote while learning DR. RACKET in my first CS course CS 115 at the University of Waterloo. 
They teach computer science concepts in the context of the functional programming language Racket, a close relative of the older language Scheme.
These are the Homework assignment codes which I worked on with no assisstance outside assisstance.
